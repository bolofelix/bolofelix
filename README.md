I would describe myself as a collaborative and solution-driven IT Technician with over two years of experience working with designers, developers, and programmers holding an associates degree from Unity School of proffessional studies and Course Careers. 
Something I’ve enjoyed and has been able to use in my current role is leveraging my experience in tech support to help identify and resolve complex issues. 

And over the last year, I worked on several project teams using Azure from CourseCareers and also I signed up and started an online A+ course subject to end on the 31st of January 2023 with the goal to increase my knowledge and prowes as quick as possible in the IT World.

 I believe my experience has allowed me to hone my attention to detail and critical thinking skills as well as enhance my communication skills working on team-based projects and with clients. 

In my last role in tech support, I received several commendations from customers where I was able to identify and resolve their technical issues with clarity and ease. 

I’m excited to collaborate on a team and apply my technical skills to develop applications and systems along with contributing to your team in a way that positively impacts the organization and your clients”
